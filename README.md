# Mayor

Overhauled village gameplay mod for Fabric 1.21.

### Installation
Mayor is a mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/). It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) to be installed separately; all other dependencies are installed with the mod.

### License
Mayor is licensed under MIT.

### Datapacks
For each village structure an experience value and a price value can be set.  
The folder path has to be ```data\modid\structure_data\YOURFILE.json```  
An example can be found below:

```json
{
  "plains_small_house_1": {
    "replace": false,
    "experience": 3000,
    "price": 24
  }
}
```
